# Helm

Personal live task board, readable by you and by AI agents.

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env        # set HELM_OWNER_PASSWORD and HELM_SESSION_SECRET
pnpm --filter @helm/server seed   # optional sample data
pnpm dev                    # server on :8787, web on :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and sign in with `HELM_OWNER_PASSWORD`.

## Use it as an app

```bash
pnpm build                  # builds the PWA into apps/web/dist
pnpm start                  # server on :8787 serves the API and the app (HELM_WEB_DIST)
```

Open http://localhost:8787 and install it from the browser (the install icon in the address
bar in Chrome or Edge). The installed app:

- opens without a connection, showing the last board it saw (marked Offline); changes need
  the server and say so if they can't be saved
- updates itself when a new build is served, checking hourly while it stays open
- keeps the board, projects and sign-in state in the browser's local storage on that device,
  cleared when the session ends

Installing needs a secure origin: `localhost` works; for a phone, serve it over HTTPS
(for example `tailscale serve`) and set `HELM_COOKIE_SECURE=true`.

## Connect AI assistants

In Helm, open Settings (the cog) and create a token for each assistant or script. Choose read
only or read and change, all projects or only some, and an optional expiry. The token is shown
once; Helm keeps only its SHA-256. Revoking takes effect immediately, including open streams.

**MCP** (Streamable HTTP) at `/mcp`, bearer token only:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http helm http://localhost:8787/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer helm_..."
```

Tools: `get_focus`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `list_projects`, `list_done`, and with read and
change access `create_task`, `update_task`, `start_task`, `pause_task`, `complete_task`,
`reopen_task`, `move_task`. Read-only tokens only see the read tools. There is no delete tool.

**REST**: every `/api/v1` endpoint accepts `Authorization: Bearer helm_...`, with the same
scope rules. Tasks created with a token are marked `ai:<token name>`.

Assistants that only accept OAuth connectors (such as Claude or ChatGPT on the web) can't use a
plain token yet.

## Layout

```
apps/server     Hono API, SSE stream, services (all rules live here), modules
apps/web        React PWA
packages/shared zod schemas, types, pure logic (tree, focus)
packages/db     Drizzle schema + SQLite migrations
```

Every write goes through `apps/server/src/core/services`. REST, MCP and AI modules call the
same services with a `Principal`, so scope checks and events happen in one place.

## Scripts

- `pnpm test`: all tests
- `pnpm typecheck`: all packages
- `pnpm db:generate`: new migration after editing `packages/db/src/schema.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @helm/web icons`: regenerate app icons after editing `apps/web/scripts/icons.mjs`

## Config

See `.env.example`. Task rules are config, not code:
`HELM_IN_PROGRESS_LIMIT` (default 1, 0 = unlimited) and `HELM_MAX_SUBTASK_DEPTH` (default 1).
